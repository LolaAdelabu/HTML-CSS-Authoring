            <li>She was born on July 16th, 1862, in Holly Springs, Mississippi. She was born into slavery, right before the end of the Civil War</li>

<li>She went to Rust University, a freedman’s school. Afterwards, she started teaching at the age of 14</li>

<li>One day, when she was riding back to school, she was told to give up her seat in the ladies coach. As a result, she was kicked off of the train</li>

<li>She fought the train company in a suit. Initially, she won the suit, but then the decision was reversed, and she lost. This enraged her, and she wrote about her story, which was forwarded to various Black-owned newspaper companies. This kick started her career in journalism</li>

<li>In 1892, three of her friends, Thomas Moss, Henry Stwart, and Calvin McDowell, were murdered in a lynch mob. This opened her eyes to the brutal and unjust nature of lynching and triggered her fight against lynching.</li>

<li>
She used her writing and editorials to expose the unjust nature of lynchings, as well as the unfounded claims made against Black people that caused their lynchings. </li>

<li>
Her editorials about lynchings angered racist whites, which led to her office being destroyed and her life in jeopardy. This caused her exile from the South. She brought her anti-lynching campaign to England to bring more attention to the issue of lynching</li>

<li>After she spread world-wide awareness of lynching, the rate of lynchings went down in the US</li>

<li>She continued her fight against racial injustice towards African Americans, and even took part in the Women's Suffrage movement</li>

<li>She died in Chicago, Illinois, on March 25th, 1931</li>
